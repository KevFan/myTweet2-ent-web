## Pre-requisites

To get started, you'll need to have the following requirements installed

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* npm (Installed with Node.js)
* [MongoDB 2.6.x / 3.2.x](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

## Getting started
	
	# Ensure `mongod` is running, either as a service or in another shell
	git clone <this repo>
	npm install
	npm start

These commands would host the project locally and seed the database with default data.
The project can then be viewed on <http://localhost:4000/>

## Running tests

Endpoints of the API are tested using mocha/chai.
To run tests enter:
 ```
 # Ensure the project is hosted locally and database seeded (see getting started)
 # Open another terminal
 npm test

 ```

Mochawesome test reports are also generated and included which can be found in the project directory:

```
myTweet-enterprise-web/mochawesome-report/mochawesome.html
```

## User Instructions:
After hosting the project locally, users can signup or login using the preloaded accounts provided: 
```
User Accounts:

email: homer@simpson.com
password: secret

email: marge@simpson.com
password: secret

email: bart@simpson.com
password: secret
```
There is also a preloaded admin accounts that can delete users and tweets 
```
Admin Account:

email: admin@simpson.com
password: secret

email: granpa@simpson.com
password: secret
```

Alternatively, for the deployed version, you can visit <https://mytweet-ent.herokuapp.com/>. The above default accounts can also be used to log in the deployed version if they have not been deleted.

## List of Software + Technologies Used
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime
* [MongoDB 2.6.x / 3.2.x](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) / [Mlab](https://mlab.com/welcome/) - document database
* [Hapi](https://hapijs.com/) - Node.js Web Framework
* [mochawesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mochawesome) - Testing report
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - JavaScript test framework
* [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) - Deployment platform
* [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - JavaScript IDE

## Improvements
* Add user profile pictures
* Secure the API - by knowing the endpoints, anyone can create, find, delete and update to the database. This includes deleting users and creating new admins etc.
* Should seed the database before each test suit so that each test are independent of each other, and improve user friendliness of test command by not having to open two terminals
* More user error checking, e.g. not allowing a user to sign up using an email address already used by another user + confirm deletes etc.
* Use a Front End framework, such as REACT/Angular that would consume the REST Api and build a single page application instead of using application routes and server rendered views.
